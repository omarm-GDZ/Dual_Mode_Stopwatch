# Dual_Mode_Stopwatch
## Project Title:  
Stopwatch with Dual Mode (Increment and Countdown) Using ATmega32 and Seven-Segment 
Display. 
## Objective: 
To design and implement a digital stopwatch with two operational modes: counting up 
(increment mode) and counting down (countdown mode). The project utilizes an ATmega32 
microcontroller, six multiplexed seven-segment displays (common anode), and multiple push 
buttons for user interaction. 
## Features
Reset Function: Instantly reset the timer via external interrupt.
Pause & Resume: Pause the stopwatch and resume from where you left off.
Mode Toggle: Switch between Increment Mode (standard stopwatch) and Countdown Mode, with LED indicators to show the active mode.
Time Adjustments: Modify hours, minutes, and seconds using push buttons, even while the stopwatch is running.
Buzzer Alert: Goes off when the countdown reaches zero.
