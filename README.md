# Dual_Mode_Stopwatch
## Project Title:  
Stopwatch with Dual Mode (Increment and Countdown) Using ATmega32 and Seven-Segment 
Display. 
## Objective: 
To design and implement a digital stopwatch with two operational modes: counting up 
(increment mode) and counting down (countdown mode). The project utilizes an ATmega32 
microcontroller, six multiplexed seven-segment displays (common anode), and multiple push 
buttons for user interaction. 
## Features
- **Reset Function**: Instantly reset the timer via an external interrupt for quick restart.
- **Pause & Resume**: Pause the stopwatch and resume it from the last point without losing progress.
- **Mode Toggle**: Switch between two modes:
  - **Increment Mode**: Functions as a standard stopwatch.
  - **Countdown Mode**: Set a countdown with the ability to switch between modes easily.
  - LED indicators show the current active mode.
- **Time Adjustments**: Modify hours, minutes, and seconds using push buttons, even while the stopwatch is running.
- **Buzzer Alert**: A buzzer sounds off when the countdown reaches zero, providing an audible alert.
