# Dual_Mode_Stopwatch
## Project Title:  
Stopwatch with Dual Mode (Increment and Countdown) Using ATmega32 and Seven-Segment 
Display. 
## Objective: 
To design and implement a digital stopwatch with two operational modes: counting up 
(increment mode) and counting down (countdown mode). The project utilizes an ATmega32 
microcontroller, six multiplexed seven-segment displays (common anode), and multiple push 
buttons for user interaction.
